## API Reference

---

This component is based on the [Radix UI Dropdown Menu]("https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dropdown-menu") primitives
and makes use of [Downshift](https://www.downshift-js.com/) hooks for statefulness.

### Select

<ComponentProps component="select" />

### Select.Trigger

<ComponentProps component="select-trigger" />

### Select.TriggerIcon

This component is based on the `div` element and supports all props of this element.

<br />
If no children are provided, it uses the `ChevronUpDown` icon by default.

### Select.Value

This component is based on the `div` element and supports all props of this element.

<ComponentProps component="select-value" />

### Select.Item

<ComponentProps component="select-item" />

### Select.SelectAll

This component is based on the `div` element and supports all props of this element.

### useSelectContext

This hook can be used to access the underlying state of the select, via the context that wraps it. It returns the value of [Downshift's `useSelect` hook](https://www.downshift-js.com/use-select/) as well as a few additional properties.

<HookValues hook="useSelectContext" />

### Searchable

The trigger can be turned into an input, to allow for searching or item creation.
These actions need to be performed at implementation level.
See the "Search and Create" example below for a basic idea.

### Multi

<ComponentExample name="select-multi" />

### Multi with Select All

### Search and Create

By hooking into the `onSearch` prop, you can read the input's value and perform actions such as searching
within your items or triggering an item creation flow, where appropriate.

<ComponentExample name="select-search-and-create" />

### Scroll Pagination

You can attach a handler to the root's `onScrollToBottom` listener and perform actions such as pagination.
